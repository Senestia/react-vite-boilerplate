You can do a web search to find more information about the libraries and components.


Code should follow below guidelines:
1. Write minimal code to achieve the task.
2. Write code that is easy to read and understand.
3. Do not write comments unless necessary to explain complex logic.
4. Try to reuse existing code and components as much as possible.
5. Do not refactor unless necessary such as seeing 3 duplicated code blocks.
6. Write secure code following secure coding guidelines from OWASP.
